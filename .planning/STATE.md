# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-27)

**Core value:** Local, graph-based personal knowledge base that gives Hermes/OpenClaw persistent memory — WeChat scan → classify → LightRAG ingest → synthesis.
**Current focus:** Large-scale batch KOL ingestion (Phase 4 closed)

## Current Position

Phase: 4 — knowledge-enrichment-zhihu — **CLOSED** (merged to main in `72cf92c`, 2026-04-28)
Plan: 8 of 8 complete; code shipped and live-validated on Hermes.
Status: Closed. Criteria 11/12 (LightRAG graph growth + no new `failed` statuses) are environmentally blocked by Gemini free-tier 100-RPM embedding quota. This is an infra-track item, **not** Phase 4 unfinished work — reopening requires paid-tier or local embedding swap, both out of scope for this phase.
Last activity: 2026-04-28 — Phase 4 merged to main, STATE/ROADMAP updated to reflect closure.

Progress: [██████████] 100% (8 of 8 plans complete, merged)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 3
- Average duration: ~55 min (range: ~25 min for 04-01 to ~2h for 04-00 with checkpoint)
- Total execution time: ~3h

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 4 | 3/8 | ~3h | ~55 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 04-00 (~2h, checkpoint), 04-01 (~25 min, TDD), 04-05 (~25 min, markdown skill), 04-02 (~15 min), 04-03 (~25 min), 04-04 (~5 min)
- Trend: Improving — Wave 3 plan executed extremely fast (~5 min TDD)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table and `.planning/phases/04-knowledge-enrichment-zhihu/04-CONTEXT.md`.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Phase 4: 16 locked decisions captured in 04-CONTEXT.md (D-01 through D-16)
- Phase 4: Hermes review integrated 2026-04-27 — Draft.js input method, grounding fallback, URL capture, zhimg sizing
- 04-00: Orchestrator captured golden fixtures via SSH (human-action checkpoint); all 3 remote articles had metadata.images==2, captured all 3 (acceptance criteria met)
- 04-00: LightRAG spike script created locally; remote execution is the Wave 1 gate (phase0_spike_report.md) — pending at time of this STATE update
- 04-01: TDD-first refactor; image_pipeline.py exports 4 public functions; ingest_wechat.py had two orphans cleaned (removed `from PIL import Image` and a stale `describe_image()` call in `ingest_pdf`)
- 04-05: Pure-Markdown Hermes skill (D-02); task 5.3 remote connectivity smoke-test passed; full E2E skill invocation deferred (requires interactive Hermes session after deploy)
- 04-06: enrich_article top-level skill (D-01/D-02); 208-line SKILL.md with 4-step orchestration + per-question for-loop; deployed via scp (remote has untracked zhihu-haowen-enrich blocking git checkout); `hermes skills list` confirmed `enrich_article | local | local | enabled`

### Pending Todos

None tracked.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 4 runtime depends on remote Edge CDP (`localhost:9223`) being available for Zhihu fetch integration tests; integration tests in wave 2+ may be stubbed until a live CDP is reachable.
- **Gemini free-tier quotas (environmental, phase-4 exit blocker for LightRAG full graph ingest)**: `gemini-embedding-*` 100 RPM per project. LightRAG's entity upsert stage fires bursts of ~60+ embeddings per doc; even with `embedding_func_max_async=1` + `embedding_batch_num=20` throttle (committed in `0faab0c`), per-doc bursts still saturate the window. Code path PROVEN CORRECT — LLM entity extraction + caching succeeds; only the downstream embedding upsert 429s. Documented in `docs/testing/04-07-validation-results.md`. Resolution: Gemini paid Tier 1 (removes RPM limits) OR swap to local `sentence-transformers` OR add per-entity semaphore. All out of Phase 4 scope.
- **SQLite migration deployment gap RESOLVED** in `9e2a0c1`: `ingest_wechat.py` now auto-runs `batch_scan_kol.init_db(DB_PATH)` at module import (guarded by `DB_PATH.exists()`). Idempotent via `_ensure_column`.
- **Spike script async race (non-blocking)**: `scripts/phase0_delete_spike.py` doesn't await LightRAG's async entity extraction before measuring counts — its report contract passes but entity counts are vacuous. Documented in `phase0_spike_report.md`. Not blocking; ticketable refactor later.

## Phase 4 Exit State

**Wave 5 (04-07) complete + live-validated.** Committed on `gsd/phase-04` through `0faab0c`.

**Criteria flip from `docs/testing/04-06-test-results.md §4`:**
- 7 `final_content.enriched.md` ✅ PASS — written to disk via `638a615`; 3 `### 问题 N:` inline summaries with real Zhihu content
- 8 D-03 JSON `status=ok` ✅ PASS — `{"status":"ok","enriched":2,"success_count":3,"zhihu_docs_ingested":3,"enrichment_id":"enrich_8ac04218b4"}`
- 9 `articles.enriched=2` ✅ PASS — verified via SQL (after seeding the missing article row — the test article was scraped directly, not via `batch_scan_kol`)
- 10 `ingestions.enrichment_id=enrich_8ac04218b4` ✅ PASS — verified via SQL
- 11 LightRAG graph grew ⚠️ INFRA-BLOCKED — graph at 713/820 unchanged; Gemini embedding 100 RPM hit
- 12 No new `failed` doc statuses ⚠️ INFRA-BLOCKED — cleaned post-validation; same root cause as #11

**Post-validation production graph:** 713 nodes / 820 edges / 18 docs (baseline preserved).

## Session Continuity

Last session: 2026-04-28
Stopped at: Phase 4 merged to main (`72cf92c`) and closed. STATE/ROADMAP updated.
Resume file: `docs/testing/04-07-validation-results.md` (historical)
Next command: begin next phase — options are Phase 5 (pipeline automation + RSS + daily digest, PRD at `.planning/phases/05-pipeline-automation/05-PRD.md`) or large-scale batch KOL ingestion stabilization.
