# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-27)

**Core value:** Local, graph-based personal knowledge base that gives Hermes/OpenClaw persistent memory — WeChat scan → classify → LightRAG ingest → synthesis.
**Current focus:** Phase 4 — knowledge-enrichment-zhihu

## Current Position

Phase: 4 of 4 (knowledge-enrichment-zhihu)
Plan: 6 of 8 in current phase (04-00, 04-01, 04-02, 04-03, 04-04, 04-05 complete; next 04-06 in Wave 4)
Status: In progress — Wave 3 complete (04-04 merge_md + merge_and_ingest)
Last activity: 2026-04-27 — Wave 3 complete (04-04 merge_and_ingest)

Progress: [███████░░░] ~75% (6 of 8 plans complete)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 3
- Average duration: ~55 min (range: ~25 min for 04-01 to ~2h for 04-00 with checkpoint)
- Total execution time: ~3h

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 4 | 3/8 | ~3h | ~55 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 04-00 (~2h, checkpoint), 04-01 (~25 min, TDD), 04-05 (~25 min, markdown skill), 04-02 (~15 min), 04-03 (~25 min), 04-04 (~5 min)
- Trend: Improving — Wave 3 plan executed extremely fast (~5 min TDD)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table and `.planning/phases/04-knowledge-enrichment-zhihu/04-CONTEXT.md`.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Phase 4: 16 locked decisions captured in 04-CONTEXT.md (D-01 through D-16)
- Phase 4: Hermes review integrated 2026-04-27 — Draft.js input method, grounding fallback, URL capture, zhimg sizing
- 04-00: Orchestrator captured golden fixtures via SSH (human-action checkpoint); all 3 remote articles had metadata.images==2, captured all 3 (acceptance criteria met)
- 04-00: LightRAG spike script created locally; remote execution is the Wave 1 gate (phase0_spike_report.md) — pending at time of this STATE update
- 04-01: TDD-first refactor; image_pipeline.py exports 4 public functions; ingest_wechat.py had two orphans cleaned (removed `from PIL import Image` and a stale `describe_image()` call in `ingest_pdf`)
- 04-05: Pure-Markdown Hermes skill (D-02); task 5.3 remote connectivity smoke-test passed; full E2E skill invocation deferred (requires interactive Hermes session after deploy)

### Pending Todos

None tracked.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 4 runtime depends on remote Edge CDP (`localhost:9223`) being available for Zhihu fetch integration tests; integration tests in wave 2+ may be stubbed until a live CDP is reachable.

## Session Continuity

Last session: 2026-04-27
Stopped at: Wave 3 complete on `gsd/phase-04` — 04-04 merge_md + merge_and_ingest committed (95e8cb8, c75f23a, f64e407). Next: 04-06 enrich_article top-level skill (Wave 4).
