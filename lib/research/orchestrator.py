"""Agentic-RAG-v1 orchestrator (ar-4 telemetry-wired).

Single source of stage-emit ordering: the private async generator
``_run_pipeline`` runs all 5 stages and yields one event per boundary
(pipeline_start, 5x stage_start/stage_end pairs, pipeline_end).

- ``research_stream()`` returns directly from ``_run_pipeline`` — its
  consumers see every event the pipeline emits in real time.
- ``research()`` consumes ``_run_pipeline`` and builds ``ResearchResult``
  from the closure-captured ``ResearchState`` instance.

Both surfaces honour ``cfg.telemetry_jsonl`` identically: when set, every
event is also appended via :func:`write_event`. Sink-disabled (None) does
no file I/O (Axis 4 opt-in side effect).

Pure async entrypoint (Axis 1) — no print, no argv parsing in this file.
Stage modules are imported lazily inside ``_run_pipeline`` so a stage
import-time failure doesn't poison module load.
